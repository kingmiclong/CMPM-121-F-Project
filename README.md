# Devlog Entry - [11/19/2023]

## Introducing the team
- Tools Lead: JustInTime
- Engine Lead: MicLong
- Design Lead: NoComp

## Tools and materials
- Framework: Phaser
- Engine: 
- Library: Nodes, jQuery
- Languages: TypeScript/Javascript
- IDE: Visual Studio Code

## Outlook
Our team might accomplish something without using an Engine, unlike other teams. The risky part might be the time-consuming aspect of building everything from scratch, especially while people have midterms and finals. We are hoping to learn and adapt to write more efficient and maintainable code.
