# Devlog Entry - [11/19/2023]

## Introducing the team
- Tools Lead: JustInTime
- Engine Lead: MicLong
- Design Lead: NoComp

## Tools and materials
### Engine/Library/Framework: Phaser 3
- **Description:** Phaser 3 is a popular and versatile HTML5 game framework for building 2D games using JavaScript.
- **Motivation:** Phaser 3 is easy to use, and has been something we have learned about in previous classes. It is convenient and provides a nice starting point.

### Language: JavaScript with Phaser 3
- **Description:** JavaScript is a widely used programming language for web development. When coupled with Phaser 3, it becomes the primary language for developing your game.
- **Motivation:** JavaScript is a language that we, as a group, are fairly comfortable with. We believe that it will be a good choice for our group.

### Tools: Visual Studio Code
- **Description:** Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a lightweight yet powerful source code editor known for its rich features, support for various programming languages, and a vast library of extensions.
- **Motivation:** VS Code seems to be a standard tool that is recommended in all of our coding classes. We figured that it fit perfectly well with this project.

## Outlook
The goal of our team is to add some aspects of realism to our game, that may not be present in other games. We are doing additional research into plant types, which can add some more immersion into our game. I think the hardest part of the project will be managing our scope, which can easily be blown out of proportion in such a short period of time. I hope to learn how to properly document and iterate on our game, while focusing on organization and planning, as well as refactoring.
